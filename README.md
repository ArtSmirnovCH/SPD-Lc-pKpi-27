### Project Description    
The project involves the complete chain of generation, detector simulation, and event analysis for the full-scale simulation of the production of the charmed $\Lambda_c^+$ baryon under the conditions of the second stage of the SPD experiment at the NICA collider. The decay channel under study is $\Lambda_c^{+} \to p^{+}K^{-}\pi^{+}$. 

### Objectives:
* Conduct reliable simulation of the production of the charmed $\Lambda_c^+$ baryon.

* Perform accurate simulation of the SPD detector in the configuration of the second stage of the experiment.

* Create a dataset of signal and background events.

* Develop a signal selection algorithm.

* Evaluate the feasibility of observing and studying the properties of the $\Lambda_c^+$ baryon with the SPD detector.

* To assess the feasibility of measuring Transverse Single Spin Asymmetry of $\Lambda_c^+$ production by evaluating statistical uncertainties.
